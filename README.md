This project is an E-Commerce Website with a database. This project gives information about a product at all the phases i.e., starting from the ordering of the product by the customer until the product has been delivered to the customer. This project not only deals with the phases of a product but also everything that a company running the E-Commerce website will be doing in the background (i.e., employees, salaries, payments, receipts).
Since this project is an E-commerce and database design, we will be creating a website for the customers to interact. When the customer has selected a particular type (tab) of item (like electronics in Amazon.com) then all the items of that particular type have to be displayed. To do that we will be using java. So, when a tab is clicked upon, then a request (query) will be sent to the database. 
To summarize, we will be using JavaServer Pages (JSP) to create the website, Java (Eclipse IDE) to write complex queries for the database and Oracle 10g to create our database.
We have researched about the different ways to create a database, website and how to use a website to show what are all the things there are in the database. We feel that JSP, Java and Oracle 10g will be feasible for us to do the project. 
Until now we have tried to figure out what are all the different categories that are possible in the project we will be creating and we have listed out the categories and the relevant table that are possible in the categories.
Human Resources:
This will have information about the employees, their salaries, benefits etc.
Items Inventory:
This will have the information of all the products there are in the warehouses of the company and also a list of the items which will be sold in the near future etc.
Accounts:
This will have information about ordering, payments, receipts etc.
Website: 
This will be a website for the customer interface.

The list of the tables possible in the project are: 
Admin (The list of all the people with admin rights)
Higher management (The list of people who are at the top of the company hierarchy)
Employees (All the employees working for the company)
Customers (List of all the customers)
Item Category (List of all the categories of all the items)
Products (List of all products there are)
Cart (the list of all items selected by the customer)
Order confirmation table 
Supplier (List of all suppliers the company is working with for the products)
Delivery reports (Status and reports of all the deliveries)
